# üìÑ PDF Extract & Merge & Page Reorder Tool

Need to add a handwritten ("wet") signature to only the last page of a PDF while preserving lossless PDF integrity?  Print, sign, and merge ‚Äî without ever touching the other pages.  Here are a few common scenarios:

- Sign‚Äëonly the last page of long contractsSkip wasting paper on 20+ pages. Extract the final page, sign it, then merge it back in seconds.

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these simple steps to get the application up and running on your computer:

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, you need to install the necessary Python libraries. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to keep your project dependencies organized.

```bash
# Create a virtual environment (if you don't have one)
python -m venv venv

# Activate the virtual environment
# On Windows:
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install the required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Application

Once the dependencies are installed, you can start the Gradio application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Your web browser should automatically open a new tab with the application interface. If not, copy and paste the URL displayed in your terminal (usually `http://127.0.0.1:7860`) into your browser.
